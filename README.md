This code is a Streamlit application that uses the Ollama language model to respond to user questions. Here's what each part of the code does:

1. **Importing Libraries**: The Streamlit and Ollama libraries are imported to build the application and use the language model.

2. **`llm_model` Function**: This function contains the main code of the application. It allows the user to ask a question via a chat input field. Once the question is asked, the code sends the question to the Ollama language model to get a response. The response is then displayed in the application's user interface.

3. **`main` Function**: This function simply calls the `llm_model` function to run the application.

4. **`if __name__ == "__main__":` Condition**: This condition checks if the script is being executed directly as the main program. If so, the `main` function is called to launch the application.

In summary, this code creates a simple user interface where users can ask questions and get responses generated by a language model provided by Ollama.
